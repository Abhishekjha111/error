**Requirement:**
- The requirement is to develop a Python script for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that can be used with minimal effort.
- The script should accept an image file path as input, perform OCR on it, and provide output in both a visual format (bounding boxes around recognized text) and a structured format (CSV file containing recognized text and probabilities).

**Solution Proposed:**
- The solution leverages Python and popular libraries to streamline OCR tasks.
- Key libraries used include:
  - `cv2` (OpenCV): Used for image processing.
  - `sys`: Provides access to system-related functions.
  - `easyocr`: Simplifies OCR operations.
  - `csv`: Facilitates CSV file operations.
- The script is designed for simplicity and efficiency, requiring minimal setup.
- It initializes an OCR reader for English language text recognition using the `easyocr` library.
- Users can specify the image file path as a command-line argument.
- The script reads the image, converts it to bytes, and conducts OCR analysis.
- OCR results are processed, extracting text, bounding boxes, and confidence probabilities.
- Bounding boxes are overlaid onto the original image to visually highlight recognized text regions.
- The recognized text and corresponding probabilities are systematically saved in a CSV file.
- The script also offers a real-time view of the image with overlays of bounding boxes and recognized text.

**System and Package Requirements:**
- A Python 3.x environment.
- The following Python libraries must be installed:
  - `cv2` (OpenCV): Install using `pip install opencv-python`.
  - `easyocr`: Install via `pip install easyocr`.

**Output Format:**
- The script generates the following output:
  - A 'ocr_result.csv' file containing recognized text and their associated probabilities.
  - A visual window displaying the original image with superimposed bounding boxes around identified text regions, along with the recognized text and probabilities.

Note: Ensure you adjust the `impath` variable in the code to specify the actual image file you want to process. This solution simplifies OCR tasks while providing both visual and structured output for ease of use.
